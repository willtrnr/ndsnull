{"q":"knowledge","paragraphs":{"0":"In addition to the examination questions, students were asked how many political science courses they had previously taken. They were also asked if they had taken the basic American government course, and if so where (i.e., Cal State LA, a community college). Students were also asked to identify their option in political science (i.e., general, pre-legal, public administration, or world politics) and to identify writing courses and requirements they had completed.","1":"Part two focuses on document formatting and label and envelope printing Learn to enhance the appearance of your document in part three Learn to use tables and graphics in part four Part five explains the AutoFormat feature Learn to use Wizards in part six.","2":"Student assistants should not have direct access to student, faculty, or staff data, nor should they have a password to access confidential data systems. If pre-approved, some students may assist with data input if a designated supervisor signs them onto the necessary system. Students may not remove any printed information from any department office without authorization from their immediate supervisor. Only authorized individuals may view confidential data, so everyone must try to safeguard confidential information on desks, copiers, and printers from the sight of others.","3":"I realize, upon writing this short (well, maybe not so short) document, that there is a 99% chance this is a futile effort - not for any other reason than the fact that eighteen year olds just really don't want to hear it. When I was eighteen, everything I intend to write down here was told to me at one point or another by many different people, and unfortunately, I just didn't give a damn. Had I listened, my life would have been much, much easier, and that is the reason I decided to write this.","4":"So, even if Fodor is right about representation, it remains true that real science cannot be learned just from lectures and textbooks. Being able to parrot the physics textbook perfectly does not amount to a knowledge of physics. Of course, in the real world, if I learn my physics text by heart, I will learn something about physics. I know everyday English, and most of the words found in the text are either ordinary English words, or are used in ways very close to their everyday meanings. I would be able (and likely) to make many inferential connections amongst the statements in the book, and between them and statements that I believe on other grounds. I would also be able to answer a lot of questions about physics, and perhaps even be able to pass a written examination in the subject. However, I hope you would think twice before letting me loose in a physics laboratory or, a fortiori an engineering workshop.","5":"My goal is to teach courses in my areas of interest and make students feel proud that they chose Electrical Engineering as their field of study. Since 1987 I have taught undergraduate and graduate courses at Cal State University, Los Angeles.","6":"Did you notice that this example again demonstrates using the OR operator to make a big set containing all subject headings related to one concept? This example also shows how it helps to review a set of headings OR'ed together once more with Expand--in this case,  this step uncovered another relevant subject heading, \"Transgenic animals,\" which needed to be included using the OR operator.","7":"The university may place an administrative hold on registration transactions and release of records and transcripts of a student who has been sent a notice of discipline and may withhold awarding a degree otherwise earned until the completion of the process set forth in the Student Conduct Code, including the completion of all sanctions imposed.","8":"Faculty members and students have a major role in the governance of the University through the Academic Senate, which is the official representative body of the faculty. The Senate recommends policy to the President. If the President rejects a Senate proposal, the Chair of the Senate is informed in writing of the compelling reasons for rejection of the Senate recommendation. All full-time members of the faculty are eligible for election to the Senate, whose membership also includes five student voting members and one emeritus faculty voting member. See Appendix B, \"The Constitution of the Faculty of California State University, Los Angeles.\"","9":"Accordingly, the department\/division\/school or other academic unit is expected to respond within two weeks after receipt of the proposal; absent such response, it is to be assumed that there are no compelling objections and the Office of Extended Education may proceed with the course offering. For any instance in which the Dean of Extended Education and the dean of the college responsible for the academic discipline involved fail to reach agreement on approval for a course, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs will serve as the final arbiter.","10":"My goal is to publish research and write several books about ethnic minority mental health issues. I am also gathering research to study the attitudes of students, faculty\/staff, and clinical supervisors toward learning disabilities. I am focusing on students in undergraduate and graduate programs, and whether providing accommodations for learning disabilities affects teacher competency.","11":"His technical areas of specialty include graphic communications, typography, publication design, production, fine printing and industrial and technology education. He is also a former chair and principal advisor of the Department of Technology.","12":"This suggests that it is the significantly greater number of political science courses and overall greater experience at the college level of the exiting cohort that contributes to their stronger writing skills as reflected in higher paper scores. Thus, the findings presented in Tables 1, 2 and 3 are more consistent with a growth model than the GIGO\/QIQO model.","13":"Ten percent of each student's grade will be based upon the instructor's subjective evaluation of the student's participation and contributions to course information through classroom discussion. Such participation may consist partially of input based on analysis and\/or experience, and any reports the student may wish to make re current events and developments in business law.","14":"Point Average Requirement: Achievement of a minimum B(3.0) grade point average in all courses on the approved degree program. A grade of C is allowed on the program; however, any grade below C requires that the course be repeated with both grades computed in the grade point average.","15":"Hot Spot - An area of a graphic, object, or a section of text, that activates a function or action when selected. Hot spots are common in multimedia applications, where selecting a hot spot can make the application display a picture, run a video, load text, link to a Web page, or open a new window of information.","16":"Mach number at the engine inlet. The scramjet engine is simply modeled by a 1-D compressible flow with heating, which predicts the flow rate of hydrogen fuel required for a chosen design Mach number at the engine exit.","17":"The evaluation of related educational activities is based upon such items as surveys of student opinions of advisement, student mentoring, tutoring, field activities, etc., written reports from the department\/division chair or school director, students, faculty, and\/or other individuals with first hand knowledge of the faculty member's activities; and other such documentation provided by the faculty member regarding participation in program assessment, curriculum development, and other related educational activities.","18":"A spyware application can arrive to your computer and install itself in various ways. It can arrive in an email or in an email attachment, through a pop-up window or ad, through a Web page, through an instant messenger service, through a file sharing program, and even through bundled software that you purchase and install (often disclosed in  the license agreement). Fortunately there are  anti-spyware applications you can install that will scan your computer for spyware and remove it.","19":"The University in its quest for truth and knowledge embraces honesty and integrity. These fundamental values must not be compromised. The trust and respect among professors, students and the society need to be vigilantly protected. Cheating and plagiarism can be neither justified nor condoned as this would destroy the ideals and purposes of higher education. Students enter the University to gain the knowledge and tools necessary for participation in society. Academic integrity is a foundation for society based on trust and honesty. Therefore, the University takes seriously its responsibility for academic honesty.","20":"As a result two widely different schools may end up  close together in rank, appearing more alike than they are.  Policy actions such as rewarding or punishing schools that perform good, respectively bad, based on the result of such an analysis, would be clearly unfair.","21":"Thank you for your interest in the College of Health and Human Services at Cal State LA. The faculty, staff, and administrators in the College of Health and Human Services prepare human service professionals through the use of an interdisciplinary framework that values and promotes integration of teaching, research, policy and pubic service to become effective and innovative practitioners.  Our graduates provide service and leadership on behalf of individuals, families, groups, and communities from a range of multicultural backgrounds that live and\/or are situated in urban settings.","22":"In the words of [Raudenbush(1995)] Rather than looking at schools as adding a constant to each student's knowledge, schools are viewed as modifying the entire distribution of outcomes within them, .., consistent with the best thinking in sociology of education.  ...  School effects are increasingly conceptualized as effects on learning rates rather than on status.","23":"My husband, Roland Carpenter, is an emeritus professor from CSLA. His discipline is Astronomy and Physics. He had the reputation of being one of the best teachers in his department, teaching courses from General Education Astronomy to advanced courses in Relativity and other topics. He teaches on a part-time basis when he frees himself from his work at his computer and his studies in current theories in quantum mechanics.","24":"Creating a database: table, query, form and report with Microsoft Office Access. Student will create a database with 20 or more records, containing first name, last name, telephone numbers and addresses. Then will print a report sort in alphabetical order and containing only the requested fields and records.","25":"Dell gives the option to buy a media slice that can include a floppy-drive in one bay and 8x DVD\/CD-RW combo drive in another. Dell's thorough design and sleek style is visible in the smallest details. The small CD-ROM's cable fits perfectly in the cable slot at bottom, making it all the more appealing. The dual sliding locks make is extremely easy to attach and remove the media slice.","26":"The staff at the Health Center, during the hours it is open, will provide an initial examination and administer first aid for minor cuts (abrasions or bruises should be attended to by the department\/division\/school). If further treatment is indicated, the Center will refer the faculty member to an appropriate medical facility for treatment. If additional treatment is required and the faculty member desires to obtain medical services through a doctor or clinic of their choice, after thirty days, arrangements must be made through the Office of Human Resources Management.","27":"Transfer credit will not be granted until the student has satisfactorily completed one full-time term of work or 16 quarter units.  Grades earned in graduate courses for which transfer credit is granted are included in grade point averages.","28":"Select a coherent program of 16 units lecture and design electives, which may include a maximum of 4 units from related fields with departmental approval, plus 1 unit of laboratory electives. A minimum of 8 units must be selected from the group designated as design electives. A minimum of 12 units in upper division electives must be taken in residence at Cal State L.A.","29":"Internet Explorer is Microsoft web browser that makes it easy to browse web pages and find information on the Internet.

A list of these research principal investigators and a brief description of their research interests is given at Research Training Faculty. These faculty members are among the best teacher-scholars at the University.","32":"Become familiar with what will be expected of you on test day. Knowing the format of the WPE (for example, the recommended minimum length of the essay you will write and other test directions) can save you precious minutes on this timed writing - time you might use to revise and proofread your work. The Writing Center can provide you with all the preparatory information you will need to be ready to do your best on the WPE. WPE information handouts are available at the Writing Center.","33":"Moreover, if, as suggested, each cell in the array holds several symbols, for various represented qualities, there is no need for even the symbols within a single cell to be represented in physically close memory elements.","34":"Certificate students have exposure to the theories, dynamics and current thinking in these areas. Many students report that understanding themselves and other family members in a new way was an unexpected benefit of the Certificate.","35":"University and her M.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, she has served as a Clinical Director at several facilities and an academic who has researched and published on a range of topics, including biraciality and multiculturalism; gender and race; and black women and identity in America.","36":"Table 2 compares the composition of those with health insurance with the composition of those who are uninsured. The insured population is 48% male and 52% female, while the uninsured population is 54% male and 46% female. Thus, females are more likely to be insured than males, but the differences are not very large. The common theme of this table is that needy persons and those near poverty tend to be uninsured.","37":"Once you are in the pool, you should talk to the chair one or two quarters in advance of the quarter in which you want to teach about your availability, courses of interest, hours when you can and cannot teach, etc. If you have not taught for a while, you should remind the chair with a phone call or email asking what the possibilities.","38":"Students must take the EPT before registering for any English courses unless they meet one of the exceptions described in the Admissions chapter of the University Catalog. Placement in particular English courses is dependent upon the score received on the EPT. The purpose of the EPT is to identify those students who need special help with reading and writing prior to enrolling in a college-level composition class.","39":"The Center for Student Financial Aid evaluates your financial aid eligibility only AFTER you have been officially admitted to the University AND have submitted all required documents. Once your financial aid file is complete, you should receive notification of your eligibility in about 3-4 weeks from your file completion date.","40":"RESERVES - Faculty members requesting books to be placed on reserve for their classes should so indicate and provide the course number, the quarter taught, and the desired loan period (hourly, 1-day, 2-day, or 7-day).  When received, these books will be given rush processing and sent directly to Reserves.  A lead time of at least six weeks is strongly recommended.","41":"In areas in which the faculty do not have primary responsibility the President (or his\/her designee) shall exercise decision authority consonant with the consultation procedures defined in Section 4.0.","42":"Students who are not enrolled in any credit-bearing course during the quarter in which they take the comprehensive examination must pay the comprehensive examination fee. Payment of State University, student services, facilities, and associated student fees, or any tuition charges, is not required.","43":"The reservations of the minority may be written into the full committee report as qualifications or reservations or as a separate minority opinion. Such a report shall always be included with the majority report.","44":"The above activities need to be continued for a period of time to establish a pattern of reading and language acquisition. After a few months, the summaries and other activities can be dispensed with, but the reading should continue. Remember, without input, language ability does not grow.","45":"In his book the Method, Archmedes also combines the mechanical method (using the principle of the balance) with the treatment of an n-dimensional figure as composed of an infinity of n-1-dimensional figures.","46":"Membership. The committee is composed of five tenured faculty members who hold the rank of Professor. The members are appointed by the Nominations Committee for staggered five-year terms.

Alternates shall be appointed by the Nominations Committee. The Committee elects its own officers at the first meeting of each academic year.","47":"A thesis submitted for completion of a M.S. at North Carolina State University.  This research document covers important non-technical aspects to consider when evaluating DVC focusing on human computer interaction and social issues.","48":"At the request of the faculty member being reviewed, the appropriate college shall establish an ad hoc committee to develop a written evaluation of the administrative service by interviewing those administrators and faculty members who normally come into contact with the candidate. This committee shall develop a written report prior to the closure of the personnel file for the year. The report shall be placed in the personnel file of the faculty member and shall be available for all levels of review.","49":"The expandability is often sacrificed with compactness, but it is not true for iMac design. Adding memory or installing a wireless card (AirPort) can be done effortlessly even by a first-time computer user.","50":"\"quasi-pictures\" or \"functional pictures\" rather than pictures in a literal sense (Tye, 1991). After all, the array representation in the computer (and, if it exists, in the brain) is not actually visible. The real model for the mental image is not the screen display but the underlying array representation in the computer's memory, physically instantiated as electronic states in RAM chips. Image manipulations are carried out on this array, and are merely mirrored on the screen or printout. Furthermore, the elements of the array in the memory need not be laid out in the actual spatial arrangement seen in figure 2. The representations of adjacent cells in the printout need not be in physically adjacent sections of RAM. All that matters is that they be treated as if they were adjacent by the computational routines which form, transform and inspect the array (Kosslyn, 1980).","51":"Established in the Fall of 1996 by Dr. Pamela Regan, the Social Relations Lab is one of the newest of the Psychology Department's research laboratories.  Faculty and students associated with the Lab conduct basic and applied research in the areas of interpersonal attraction, human sexuality, and close relationships.  Current projects include research on the nature of romantic love (e.g., the cognitive prototype of requited and unrequited romantic love); the association between sexual desire and romantic love (e.g., the perceived consequences of sexual desire for romantic relationships); interpersonal sexual dynamics (including sexual miscommunication, harassment, and assault); mate selection (e.g., partner preferences as a function of relationship context, sex, and mate value); and the physical attractiveness stereotype (e.g., the influence of target gender and body weight on perceptions of sexuality).  In addition, the Social Relations Lab maintains collaborative connections with social scientists and statisticians at several institutions in the U.S. and England.","52":"For false-diagrams are not contentious (their fallacious deductions do not come under the craft), at least not if it is a false-diagram concerned with truth, as in the case of the false-diagram of Hippocrates or the squaring through lunules. But the way in which Bryson squared the circle, if the circle even gets squared, since it is not directed at the fact of the matter, is sophistical on account of this. Thus the apparent syllogism concerning these things is a contentious argument, and the deduction which apparently aims at the fact of the matter, even if it is a deduction, is and contentious. For it apparently aims tat the fact of the matter, so as to be deceptive and wrong.","53":"The Executive Committee shall consist of the chair, the vice chair, and the secretary of the Academic Senate, the immediate past chair*(as a nonvoting member), the senior member of the Academic Senate CSU**(as a non-voting member), and the four other members who are elected by secret ballot by the members of the Senate for a one- year term. No more than three voting members of the Executive Committee shall be from any one college.","54":"Domestic students who are applying for the Fall and Winter quarters should take the GMAT no later than the previous June. International (visa) applicants for the Fall quarter should take the test no later than the previous January.","55":"The quality of the proposal shall be the primary criterion. In choosing among proposals otherwise judged to be equal in merit, time accrued towards a sabbatical leave may also be considered by the committee.","56":"The Center for Multicultural Research is a recent addition to the Psychology Department.  It was established in 1996 and currently has two faculty members involved, Jean Phinney and Eric Kohatsu.  Dr. Phinney's research program has been on-going for 12 years, with support of the Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) Program of the National Institutes of Health.  About four students per year have received support and research training under this program over the course of the grant.  This research program has addressed a variety of issues related to ethnic factors in adolescence, including ethinc identity development and its correlates, intergroup relations, cultural values, and adjustment in immigrant families.","57":"The low percent of correct scores in the political theory subsection of the test are disappointing, but not unexpected. Because students in the department have traditionally struggled in political theory courses, the department recently added a lower division core course in theory to the curriculum. The evidence from this study indicates that this was an appropriate move.","58":"Upon its formation, the Association was accorded recognition as the official body representing the University emeriti. The faculty strengthened the position of the Association by amending its constitution to provide for the annual election by the Emeriti Association of one its members to sit as a voting member of the Senate.","59":"It is very important that you take nothing for granted, and are aware of University regulations which affect you. Be sure that you own a University Catalog for the year you entered. This is your contract with the University. Know University policies on dropping classes; on challenging courses by examination; on being eligible for an incomplete (I); on academic performance requirements for graduation, on academic renewal. Be aware of deadlines for dropping classes, to register for the writing proficiency exam (WPE). The point is, do not sacrifice your academic standing to inaction or lack of knowledge of regulations and deadlines. In a university environment, knowledge is assumed, what you don't know will likely hurt you.","60":"Most graduate-level courses in the Department of Communication Disorders are offered after 4:00 pm. However, clinical practicum assignments usually require at least some work in earlier hours, and clinical externships in the hospitals and public schools require at least 2-3 full days per week for specified periods of time.","61":"The University will not call you about this incident unless it is in direct response to an inquiry from an affected individual. However, you may call the University's call center toll free at (800) 883-4029 for more assistance.","62":"Project SEED Scholars are integrated into active research groups under the direction of chemistry and biochemistry faculty members at Cal State LA. The student selects his\/her research adviser from among the faculty members in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and the nature and scope of the research project is arranged to suit the student's level and interests through consultation between the adviser and the student. The SEED Scholar's participation in research will be full-time during the eight-week summer. The major benefit to the SEED Scholar is the career enhancement experienced by participation in an active research group while the student is still in high school, an opportunity uncommon at most universities. The Project SEED Scholars will be in a position to interact with the best science faculty and students at the University.","63":"The conclusions based on the simulation studies, with low (but realistic) intra class correlations of 0.10 and 0.20 are, that the RC model is technically an improvement over the traditional multiple regression model, because it calculates the correct standard errors.","64":"States on the basis of acceptance by Cal State L.A. must file a special international student application (available from the Admission problems and complying with regulations governing the entry of international students, applicants can contact International Student Services, phone (323) 343-3170.","65":"Prerequisites: Instructor consent and as needed for specific topic.

The University's third solar car engineered by a team of students under the guidance of faculty and staff, the Solar Eagle III emerged from the  Sunrayce 97 intercollegiate solar car race victorious. Not only did Cal State L.A. cross the finish line first and take the national championship title, the team also set a new Sunrayce speed record. For complete details on the Solar Eagle III's rise to national champions, visit the page,  Sunrayce 97 Champs.","69":"Do as many as you can. The last day to deliver the programs is the day of the final exam. But that day I won't accept more than 3 programs per person, so send them earlier. Preferably, send each program as you finish.","70":"Educational objective: Printing Management graduates will demonstrate a cooperative and inquisitive spirit that supports the desire to pursue lifelong learning, enables them to adapt to contemporary issues in the workplace, and helps advance the goals of their organization.","71":"I doubt that anyone would seriously deny that we do experience covert verbal representation - 'inner speech'. Even J.B. Watson failed to disbelieve in it58. What might seem questionable is its status as functionally significant, and still more as an independent representational system. For, in fact, Paivio regards all mental representations as being sensorially derived, with verbal mental representations themselves consisting of images of public words, probably auditory images of spoken words59. We might now seem to have arrived at the opposite extreme to Flanagan, with, instead of a six-code, a single code theory. I want to insist, however, that Paivio has been quite right to fix on the number two, even if he has not always managed to articulate the most satisfactory reasons for doing so. There is a conceptual distinction to be drawn between the two representational systems, not in terms of sensory mode or any other experiential quality, nor even (as Paivio attempts) on the somewhat obscure basis of the systems' functional integration60, but rather in terms of the way they do their actual representing, of how they refer to their objects. Quite simply, a mental image represents what it is an image of, a mental word represents whatever it is a word for. The mental image of a weasel, be it visual, tactile, auditory, olfactory, or all four, represents a weasel; the mentally represented word \"weasel\" is the image (auditory and\/or kinaesthetic) of the spoken word \"weasel\", but it does not normally represent the spoken word \"weasel\", it represents a weasel61. We thus have a logical distinction between two types of representational system, which provides a far firmer basis for the duality of coding than any purely contingent, empirical distinctions62 could ever give us.","72":"Find out what it takes to become an astronaut.

Everything that you do for the course is geared toward the development of professional skills and habits. Due to this emphasis on the development of a professional approach to one's work, the course is designed to emphasize discussion and student participation in in-class exercises.","76":"A) and one course from Block D. Human emotions as organized within social relationships and institutions of family, religion, education, government, and economy; cultural norms and vocabulary; ethnic, sex, and social class diversity in feeling and expression.","77":"The right-hand box in figure 3 represents the array of perceptual instruments available to an organism. I take it that higher organisms are endowed (perhaps innately) with many such instruments, each specialized for making a particular type of perceptual test. In many cases different instruments may share many of the same anatomical resources: not only receptor cells and muscles, but even some of the same neural structures. Which particular instrument is in play at any one time will depend not so much on which anatomical structures are being used, as on which neural \"algorithm\" is in control of them. Switching between such algorithms may be possible \"on a rapid (~100 ms) time scale\"","78":"In Spring 1998, the Department surveyed its students and alumni for its program review, a mandatory evaluation conducted by all CSULA departments every five years. Here are the highlights of some of the findings based on the responses of 91 baccalaureate alumni (1992-97) who have completed the questionnaire survey.","79":"The MFT Program of the CSULA Psychology Department is responsive to cultural diversity.  We are committed to sensitivity and equity in education and service to members of all groups.  It is expected that students accepted to the program will share this commitment.","80":"Fifth, the microsimulation community needs more outlets to publish its research, and the development of a World Wide Web based-journal just for research on these kinds of microsimulations would be a major step in the right direction. In researching this paper, I was struck by the lack of links from the web sites of each microsimulation or research group to the web sites of others. The social science simulation community has expanded immensely with the revival of interest in social science simulations in the 1990s; more interest is clearly being expressed in microsimulations of public policy as well.","81":"The course examines health economic issues using various microeconomic tools. The purpose of the course is to provide a theoretical basis for understanding the practical issues in health plan design, management and administration.","82":"Harmit Singh, Assistant professor in Food Science program, (Ph.D. organic chemistry 1993) My research is focused on chemistry of food proteins, functional foods with health promotion or disease prevention effects. I am also interested in use of high power ultrasound (sonication) to disrupt biopolymers. Some examples of particular interest are Gluten-free products - to modify sorghum flour proteins using sonication and compare its dough making capability with wheat flour. Quantitative and antioxidant activity - evaluation of anticancer isoflavone molecules in soy foods such as tofu and soy milk Physical and enzymatic modification of cereal proteins to develop hypoallergenic foods.","83":"From the entrenched standpoint of the orthodox paradigm of 5+ senses, this theoretical perspective must seem strange and counterintuitive, but Stoffregen and Bardy throw that paradigm into deep question. Furthermore, they direct our attention toward the significant, but previously under-explored possibility that many perceptual instruments may cooperatively employ more than one receptor type. The real and considerable value of the target article lies, I think, in these challenges to entrenched orthodoxy, rather than in the unnecessary and heuristically rather unhelpful notion of the \"global array\".","84":"You may ask your college or university to forward an official transcript to you or to the Office for Student Services, King Hall D2078.  Remember, should you receive your official transcripts, do not open them.  A transcript is official only if it is sealed and bears the seal of the college or university.  Colleges and universities will only respond to written requests for transcripts.  A sample form is included in this packet for your use\/convenience.","85":"After this, I suppose that the diameter of the earth is larger than the diameter of the moon and that the diameter of the sun is larger than the diameter of the earth, and assume the same things in like manner as most of the earlier astronomers.","86":"The amount of total angular momentum determines how efficient star formation will be. Lee and Sin state that the overdense inter-vortex (outside the core) regions of their quantum vortices will increase in size as one goes from the galactic center towards the edge. Towards the edges, these regions will not be small enough and strong enough to efficiently capture baryonic matter. Therefore, if the galaxy has a small amount of total angular momentum, rapid star formation will occur only near the galaxy's center (leading to a spiral galaxy). If large tidal interactions between pre-galaxies existed, they will have large amounts of total angular momentum.","87":"It's not uncommon to meet with potential transfer students six to twelve months ahead of time prior to transfer. Planning ahead of time will save you time, money and make the transition much smoother.","88":"Courses Not for Credit. Proposals for courses not granting credit shall be submitted by the Dean of Extended Education to the appropriate academic unit (e.g., department\/division\/school, college, or interdisciplinary group) only for courses with a specific department\/division\/school orientation, and for courses which may conflict with regular University courses.","89":"An applicant with a bachelor's degree from an unaccredited institution and a master's degree from an accredited institution may be admitted as a regular postbaccalaureate or graduate student, assuming that all other requirements have been met and that appropriate approvals have occurred.","90":"The chair shall preside at all meetings of the Senate.

We will not use anecdotal cases (personal experience) as evidence in the essays you write. For now, here are examples of a hypothetical case and a textual case used as evidence to support some general observation.","92":"In the text in Aristotle discussed by Simplicius, Aristotle claims that he does not have to refute Parmenides' view that what is is just one and unchangeable. In a book on nature, he does not have to concern himself with hypotheses which reject nature altogether. He then draws a contrast between two attempts to square the circle, one through segments, and one by Antiphon. The mathematician needs to concern himself with a refutation of squaring by segments, but does not need to be concerned with refuting Antiphon's, which rejects mathematical principles.

Sixth, the cave was found to have undergone three primary stages of development, each of which impacts the cave's ecosystem and the context of the cultural materials. Preservation of the cave in its current condition is dependent on maintaining the overlying tropical flora. Seventh, the biological survey has discovered a diverse but limited fauna which may include a number of new species. The decline in bat population may have precipitated a drastic reduction or limination of species of invertebrate cave fauna.","97":"The purpose of this site is to explain the tools and procedures needed to re-image a PC.

It does not give us the guarantees that contemporary Christian fundamentalism gives: the assurance that we will like what we see, that we will be kept safe, and that a fully known and understood deity is in control. It gives, instead, simply the possibilities that we will glimpse what is, that we will have the opportunity to learn to give expression to it, and that we will be able to make peace with a fully conscious not knowing as the highest state of awareness. Where fundamentalism gives one a God who is a personal, well known friend (or, as a recent motion picture put it, \"an imaginary playmate for adults\"), mysticism gives not a protective sheltering relationship, but a solitary emptiness that invites into oneself the ultimately mysterious transcendent.","110":"Assistance in the development of assessment and evaluation instruments and guidelines for their use, as well as assistance in the evaluation of externally-funded research in the areas of teaching and learning, if available.","111":"Internet.

This is an argument in which some of the premises remain unstated or are simply assumed. For example, no one in ordinary life would think that Socrates could be immortal. We would simple assume that Socrates could be killed or that he would die of natural causes after a normal lifespan. Not all assumptions are as trivial as this one, however.","115":"It is a mark of the two methods that because Alexander's tears out the overlapping area of two sectors, while Eudemus' adds a common area to equal sets of segments, to form the lunule and rectilinear figure, that the two rectilinear areas that result will be different.","116":"Databases and printed indexes are tool that assist in the identification of articles on your topic.

This cave is so rich in artwork, artifacts, tombs, and monumental architecture that it effectively revolutionizes our picture of caves as an element of Maya social and religious life, particularly among the elite. The site possesses unique features, and gives evidence of child sacrifice, ritual bloodletting, and intercourse - sacred activates which may have been accompanied by alerted states of consciousness induced by alcoholic or hallucinogenic substances. Members of Maya royalty may be included among those who were buried there. A sacred site from as early as the late Preclassic period, around 100 B.C., this cave continued in use until the Late Classic era (A.D. 550-900), although its greatest use occurred during the Early Classic phase from A.D. 250-550.","121":"Please make sure the computer's power cord is securely connected to the wall outlet, and that the monitor is on.

The notion that minds are highly modularized first developed as a theory of contemporary human cognition (Fodor, 1983). It was then speculatively projected back into the past by the evolutionary psychology movement. But Mithen holds that the modern human mind is relatively non-modular. He seems to be sawing off the theoretical branch he sits on. If the mind of homo sapiens, the only hominid mind we can know and study directly, is not (very) modular after all, why should modularism be a good framework for understanding hominid minds in general?","140":"Second, the bill became part of the budget reconciliation agreement between the administration and the Republican congressional leadership.

Dennett has called this \"Hume's problem\". Cognitivist philosophers have generally either denied the experiential reality of thought, as did the Behaviorists, or have taken an implicitly epiphenomenalist stance, a form of dualism. Some sort of mental duality may indeed be required to meet this problem, but not one that is metaphysical or question begging.","149":"Most instructors do not require a text for this course. However, the instructor will expect students to have access to a college-level dictionary and a standard grammar and style handbook, and some assignments may require reading in magazines and newspapers.","150":"This work is not cited in the published encyclopedia entry. Unfortunately, I was unaware of Horst's work until after the encyclopedia went to press. I have added the citation here because I think that Horst demonstrates, very convincingly and with much more depth and thoroughness than does Cummins (1997), why the intentional contents of the mind cannot simply be data-structural representations in the brain. (That is not to say that such data structures do not exist.) The citation to Cummins (1997) is retained, because Cummins provides a particularly clear and succinct refutation of the popular causal theory of intentional content, and of the associated mentalese hypothesis. Cummins has greatly influenced my (and, apparently, Horst's) thinking about these issues.","151":"Note 2: Since this article went to press I have come across several books and articles (mostly very recently published) that provides further support for the Perceptual Activity Theory of mental imagery.

The required balancing force can be found from the equations of static equilibrium. Usual assumptions: bar massless; bar has sufficient strength so that it will not break; bar has sufficient rigidity so that it will not bend excessively. Other questions one may ask: What material should be used for bar? Wood, metal, plastic? How large must the bar's cross section be so that it will neither break nor bend excessively?

Please mark your rating for each item on the form that you return to the WASSC team member.  After completing your ratings for each item, average the ratings to produce a sub-category mean score.  It may be helpful to discuss each area before making an assessment judgment.  This discussion may also be useful later as you begin to develop your plan of action.  Teams can make assessment judgments at any of three levels.  First, judgments can be made at the individual item or characteristic level.  Second, each of the 8 sub-scales could be scored as a unit.  Third, using the rubric holistically, the entire school could be judged at one of the three performance levels.  Doing some degree of assessment at each level of judgment is recommended.  Depending on your reporting audience you might want to share your findings with more or less specificity. Remember, this rubric is not intended to provide a quantifiable rating for purposes of comparison.  It is simply an instrument intended to furnish an assessment team with an overall qualitative sense of their current school climate, as well as the specific aspects of that climate in their varying levels of development.","156":"A sad, poignant love story set against the social upheaval of the Vietnam war.

A particular type of symmetry which is chemically important is mirror image symmetry. If a structure is rigid, it is not hard to check whether the structure and its mirror image are the same. Recently, knots, links, and other non-planar molecules have been synthesized which do not have the rigidity that is characteristic of small molecules. If a molecule is flexible or even partially flexible, it may be able to change into its mirror image, even though it cannot be rigidly superimposed on its mirror image. In this talk we will give examples of such structures and present techniques that can be used to prove that certain flexible structures cannot change into their mirror image.","169":"District (MWD) and the Department of Water and Power (DWP) have benefitted from the experience by hiring students involved in the process.

When shopping for inkjet printers you will see various resolution sizes by manufacturer. Generally, the greater the DPI rating, the denser the ink dots are likely to blur become unnoticeable to the naked eye. With the denser dots, the printouts should look more like photos. A 720 dpi print has many visible dots. Most printers today have about 1440 - 2400 dpi depending on manufacturer. At 1440 dpi, the dots disappear at about a viewing distance of 4-7 inches. At 2400+ dpi, the dots are not noticeable at close viewing. Some printers require special papers to utilize the high dpi resolutions.","187":"Experience the process of a complete library web site redesign project.

On the other hand, this evidence will demand to be reinterpreted in the light of the major thesis of this paper, which entails that both consciousness of and manipulation of image representations necessarily involves verbal processes. An example of a loss of conscious imagery (in all modes) after a left hemisphere lesion is, indeed, suggested by the investigators to be best attributable to a disconnection between the imagery and verbal systems: A. Basso, E. Bisiach & C. Luzzatti, (1980), \"Loss of Mental Imagery: a case study.\"","193":"As a successor to the NASA funded Physics Outreach Program, CURE provides research and training opportunities in astronomy and astrophysics for students in groups traditionally underrepresented in physical and space sciences.

Resultant aerodynamic forces, total lift and drag, and engine thrust are then estimated by summation of these pressure forces and momentum change of the airflow. The unique aspect of this study is the multidisciplinary simulations of the vehicle dynamics in conjunction with the theory which enables quantification of the couplings. These couplings are broadly ignored in models used for control system design in the past.","196":"The reason why the point more distant from the center moves faster from the same force is clear through what was said, while the reason by larger balances are more precise than smaller is obvious from these things. For the rope becomes the center (since this stays put), while the lines from the center are on each side of the scale. And so from the same weight it is necessary that the end point of the scale move faster by as much as it is distant form the rope, and some weights placed on small balances are not clear in regard to perception, while in large ones they are clear. For nothing prevents it moving a magnitude smaller than would be obvious to sight. In the case of a large scale the same weight made a visible magnitude. And some are clear in both cases, but much more in the case of the larger ones due to the fact that the magnitude of the downward push from the same weight is much larger in the larger ones. And for this reason the dealers in purple use trickery in setting them up them for skimming by not placing the rope in the middle and by infusing lead into one side of the beam or by making the balance of wood towards the root where they tends to push down or if it has a knot. For it is heavier where the root of the wood is, but a knot is a sort of root.","197":"We assume that the sun moves with a constant regular motion and need to find the distance of the center of the deferent from the earth, ZE, and the angle of ZE to some fixed line, e.g., to the summer solstice, ZEX (analysis).","198":"The notes should contain the information that you want to include in your final paper. If you do this properly, you will not need to re-read the articles when completing your annotated outline, draft, and final paper. The most efficient method of taking notes will be to paraphrase the ideas\/concepts of the article. This will allow you to remember more and where you want to include it in the annotated outline. Only sentences or statements that are extremely important should be in your notes exactly as they appear in the article, as these may become direct quotes in the final paper.","199":"If the resultant moment of all external forces about a fixed point O (or G) is zero during an interval of time, then angular momentum about O (or G) is conserved. This is the principle of conservation of angular momentum.","200":"I am much inclined to disagree, and so much that is insightful, in an enterprise of this ambition there are bound to be aspects of the framework that will need further articulation. In particular, a skeptic might well worry that the crucial but underdeveloped metaphor of mastery of the sensorimotor contingencies conceals an undischarged homunculus. However, the recently proposed perceptual activity theory of mental imagery already incorporates an outline account of cognitive structures and mechanisms to support active, intelligently directed, perceptual exploration (Thomas, 1999). Although speculative, I believe this does demonstrate at least the possibility of a fully mechanistic account of sensorimotor mastery.","201":"The hearing officer makes an official audio recording of the hearing.

Even if we should someday manage to comprehensively account for the relationship between human inputs and outputs in computational terms, even if we can map this account onto neural processes, we will still have failed to give any account of human mental life75. I am not saying that brains could never be mimicked by computers, nor that 'artificial intelligences', artificial minds, are necessarily an impossibility76. What I am saying is that the program and architecture of such a computer would not amount to a psychology77. Rather it would provide a substrate or medium for a psychology, as brains do for human psychology. Understanding thought and our experience of it requires an explanation at the higher, psychological, level, and what I have tried to do in this paper is to delineate the problem and to sketch how a genuinely psychological theory might have the conceptual resources to tackle the job.","238":"Post-baccalaureate students who hold an earned doctorate or master's degree from an accredited college or university where the primary language of instruction is English may substitute such a degree for passing the Writing Proficiency Examination.","239":"Here are our video camera recommendations based on Digital handheld camcorders.

The problem is that the everyday terminology of \"images,\" \"the mind's eye,\" and \"picturing\" strongly suggests a particular sort of explanation of the phenomenon; they suggest that something significantly like an ordinary material picture, yet somehow mental, is centrally involved. This is probably the form generally taken by \"folk\" explanations of imagery, and sometimes by scientific and philosophical accounts too (see Thomas, 1987, chaps. II.A, II.B). Let us call the people who accept this sort of commonsense \"pictorial\" view \"pictorial iconophiles.\" Those who reject it, who regard the everyday terminology of \"images\" as implying a radically false theory and who thus deny that there are \"real\" mental pictures, will be \"pictorial iconophobes.\"","242":"A faculty member has the right to designate a personal physician for purposes of medical treatment.

(This can be proved from the Virial Theorem.)  This is the radius of the dark halo, and it remains fixed. If the dark halo is massive enough, then it can host material that will eventually form a luminous component. This is related to Biased Galaxy Formation-- some, not all, halos will be allowed to host, say, a collapsing luminous disk.","278":"In an extension of the above work we have designed a robust MIMO neural adaptive controller for the longitudinal dynamics of a GHV. In this case, control design can proceed with little a priori knowledge of the dynamics of the vehicle. Neural networks designed approximate the unknown dynamics with the weights being estimated on-line.

This theory, which is strikingly simple and intuitive (perhaps too much so to have caught the imagination of philosophers) has demonstrated impressive empirical power and scope. It posits two distinct systems of potentially conscious representations in the human mind: mental imagery and verbal representation (which is not to be confused with 'propositional' or \"mentalese\" representation). I defend, on conceptual grounds, Paivio's assertion of precisely two codes against interpretations which would either multiply image codes to match sense modes, or collapse the two, admittedly interacting, systems into one. On this basis I argue that the inference that a conscious agent would be needed to read such mental representations and to manipulate them in the light of their contents can be pre-empted by an account of how the two systems interact, each registering, affecting and being affected by developing associative processes within the other.","307":"Consciousness and Cognition is a cognitively oriented psychology journal that occasionally publishes articles on mental imagery.

After all, he likes to think of the beliefs, desires, etc. which are supposed to determine our behavior as being represented in \"mentalese\", the \"language of thought\", a sort of machine code of the neural computer13, but in no way would he suggest that we experience our thoughts as being in mentalese.","323":"The subcommittee executive secretary shall agendize the proposal no later than two meetings from the date of receipt of the proposal from the executive secretary of EPC.

It has broadened my knowledge and perspective toward child development. These classes have helped me to understand the behaviors of abused children. Recently, I started my internship at Free Arts and this program has helped me have a foundation in child abuse. In some ways, it has prepared me to apply certain theories such as those of Bolby and Freud. Even though I am just starting my internship I look forward to using the new knowledge and skills in my career.","371":"This connection between writing and understanding is the foundation for a category of writing assignments called \"Writing- to-Learn.\" These assignments include different types of journals and notebooks, correspondence, problem-solving, question-posing, freewriting, lecture and reading summaries, expressive and exploratory writing. The emphasis is on understanding and learning, not correctness or form, and in most cases it is not necessary to grade them. Often they are simply counted or checked off.","372":"If two substances, initially at different temperatures, are placed  in contact with each other, they will exchange heat until they reach the same temperature.  If the system is isolated from its surroundings, in a \"calorimeter\", the heat lost by the hotter substance equals the heat gained by the cooler substance.  Using this information, you can measure the latent heat of fusion of water with the equipment provided, which will be on display in lab during the previous week.  Ice \"cubes\" and water will be furnished, though not on display.","373":"Directors of the Associated Students.

Vehicles are powered by a small four-cycle engine.","378":"But if there are two such systems, they do not just differ in the accuracy of the information they represent. In other experiments, subjects seem implicitly to learn successful strategies for some task, whilst having no idea of what they have learned, or of why it would be relevant. For example, Frank Durgin & David Lewis reported an experiment in which subjects moved a mouse cursor around a computer screen in order to reveal a hidden target. They were told, and clearly continued to believe throughout the experiment, that the target was in a predetermined random position that they had to find. In fact, the position of the target was not predetermined; rather its appearance was contingent on the lengths of the sweeps across the screen that the subjects made with the cursor.","379":"In late October 2000, there were 611 results retrieved. What we have retrieved is a very large set that has only this one thing in common: each record contains the word \"motivation\" and the word \"preschool.\" This does not mean that all these books are about motivation of preschool children. In fact, probably only a small percentage of these books are about this topic; they just happen to have these two words located somewhere in their descriptions.","380":"Institute of Technology, and at a time when very few people were seriously discussing consciousness. (An even earlier version was presented at the Fourth Annual Conference of the History and Philosophy Section of the British Psychological Society - Lincoln, U.K., April 1990.) Both the abstract and the paper itself are essentially as I left them in 1991. I am no longer sure that I would want to defend everything I say in them, and I would certainly express and organise things somewhat differently today. However, I think that the basic idea is still viable, and I hope eventually to return to it and rework it.","381":"We can contribute to a better understanding of natural phenomena by bringing the talents of a broader range of individuals to focus on the solution of research problems. As scientists we seek to gain through experimentation an understanding of reality, and with that knowledge, the ability to describe, manipulate and create. This human activity progresses in proportion to the quality and novelty of the research questions posed by its practitioners, and the creative effort expended in answering these. Our human uniqueness is influenced by individual life histories and circumstances, allowing each of us to frame research questions-and the answers to these questions-from different perspectives. This is the value of diversity to science: that we can gain a better understanding of cellular, molecular, and behavioral phenomena by having many investigators form and answer research questions from various perspectives, and to subject these to experimental verification and reproduction.","382":"An Academic Dishonesty Report form describing the alleged incident shall be referred to both the student and the University Judicial Affairs Officer by the instructor.

From such a perspective, the fact that many of these processes are not consciously experienced is at first puzzling, and, when it is taken on board, when we realize that being an informational process in the brain is not enough to make something conscious, it leads to a bootless search for the mysterious X factor that raises some select few of these processes to the conscious level. Perhaps there is no such factor; perhaps none of the brain's information processing is conscious as such; if cognition is defined to mean computational information processing, then all cognition may well be implicit. We should consider the possibility that the relationship between neural information processing and conscious experiencing may be rather more indirect and complex than a simple identity. Our brains' information processing certainly has a function, it does something for us, but once we abandon identity theory, we may no longer have to say the same about consciousness itself.","396":"To avoid plagiarizing an author's language, resist the temptation to look at the source while you are summarizing or paraphrasing.

Like many psychological theorists before him, Taylor, in effect, identifies the current contents of consciousness with the current contents of \"working [or short-term] memory\". He then proposes quite a detailed neurological model of how this function might be realized in the brain, and, in perhaps his strongest chapter (14), suggests that there are special properties of the neural representations involved that make it apparent how they can be, or embody, qualia. These neural representations are referred to as \"bubbles of activity\" in the cortex, the idea apparently being that small groups of reciprocally connected neurons might mutually activate one another to attain, for a while, a self-sustaining state of excitation. Such bubbles, it is claimed, could have properties that are similar or analogous to characteristics that the philosophical literature has ascribed to qualia, such as: \"presence\", \"transparency\", \"ineffability\", and \"uniqueness\".","404":"Respect the privacy of all clients.

Although forms of this argument have been influential, I had thought it long dead and buried at the hands of such as Hannay, Fodor and Block. Tye digs it up again and, with great ceremony, drives a stake firmly through its heart.","463":"The title of the second phase deals with the significance of Tess' sexual experience in her view, in society's view, and in nature. With which of these does Hardy side? Is her sexual experience the turning point in her life, as the title suggests? Though it is clearly a crucial event, what actually happened is unclear. Was she raped or seduced? Once you decide that question, another question must be decided; how responsible is she for what happened?","464":"Although the exiting students experienced faculty turnover and curricular change during their studies at CSLA, these changes were relatively modest and incremental. At any rate, the present study was not able to control for the effect of all these possible variables. It is assumed, perhaps erroneously, that changes in such variables did not create systematic differences between the entering and exiting cohort of students.","465":"To maintain a learning and working environment free from sexual harassment, the campuses are encouraged to educate the campus community, students, and employees regarding sexual harassment. The Office of the Chancellor will make available training for persons designated to receive complaints of sexual harassment.","466":"Once again, this is very much what one would expect on the basis of PA theory, and nothing inherent in picture theory or description theory suggests the likelihood of such results (or those of Demarais & Cohen).","467":"However, even if Kosslyn proves to be mistaken in equating the occipital retinotopic maps with his imagery buffer, this will not in itself entail the wholesale rejection of his research program. It could still quite reasonably be argued that the buffer may be located elsewhere in the brain, mapped in a less obvious way. No particular claim about the buffer's neurological implementation should be taken as among pictorialism's core commitments.","468":"Come to the counter at the sociology office (KH C3093) and ask for the academic plan form. Using the advisement materials on the web and the bulletin boards, complete the form yourself. Once the form is filled out, you will then leave it for the Advisor or Department Chair to sign.

A variety of possibilities and timing were discussed. There was an overwhelming consensus that the Chancellor was preparing for the third consecutive unilateral implementation of contract conditions and, at the same time, that there is soaring faculty anger about the Chancellor's attitude toward faculty and the changes his administration is bringing to the CSU. Many participants, including the newly appointed Campus Job Action Committee members, spoke passionately about the Chancellor's thorough lack of respect for the faculty and for the importance of academic freedom to the students and to the future of the university.","472":"There shall be a chair of the Academic Senate, and such other officers as shall be specified in the Bylaws; and the time and manner of election, the length of terms and the duties and responsibilities of officers shall be specified in the Bylaws.","473":"\"Invention\" is that subject matter which is or may be sought to be patented by the University, its employees, or its students, or their respective successors in interest. \"Invention\" includes but is not limited to inventions, designs, processes, and plants.","474":"Our insight, such as it is, into the minds of extinct hominids is, surely, a matter of informed extrapolation from our own self understanding, and much the same can presumably be said for our faltering attempts to understand the minds of other animals.

The basic skills coordinator will coordinate the assignment to a basic skills adviser.","476":"Politics: The \"gap\" approach thus has a significant history in health policy. We can view the \"gap\" approach in another way politically. Much of the politics of the health and welfare area is redistributive -- politics that affects large groups, involves the general public on one side or the other, and involves the perception of being zero-sum, transferring resources from one group to another. In American politics, politicians have often attempted to redefine redistributive political situations into distributive ones, where benefits flow to a specific group that can be mobilized to support them, and costs are spread out across the general society. The gap movement involves the same idea -- focusing on specific groups who can be mobilized in support of policy change, but dampening the impact of the costs and attempting to spread them across society.","477":"I was first exposed to research during high school, through a partnership program between Mrs. Crawley from Bell High School and Dr. Jefferson.

Its role in creative thinking is derivative from this basic function. How such a faculty might operate has never been satisfactorily explained. Associative mechanisms have been seen to be insufficient, and this has led to either a mystification of the faculty (Kant, Coleridge), or to its marginalization within scientific psychologies (Behaviorism, Cognitive Science), which thus fail to confront the problem it encapsulates.","481":"MathXL to assign homework.  Some of you have asked how to incorporate this into your grading system, so to be specific, let's say that the MathXL homework grade must count towards at least 5% of the final course grade.

The two-headed dotted arrows toward the right represent the perceptual tests that can be made upon the perceived object itself, or its correlated causal products, querying the environment and returning results. The ongoing cyclical interaction between the schema, the array of instruments, and the environment is intended as equivalent to the \"perceptual cycle\" of Neisser (1976), and is hypothesized to be the material basis of conscious experience.","485":"Unfortunately, this nebulous set of expectations about what learning outcomes to expect from our majors is not unique to the CSLA department of political science. The mission and curriculum of political science departments at colleges and universities across the country vary significantly (Wahlke 1991). The curricular diversity within the discipline complicates the process of developing useful assessment standards for the discipline and makes it very doubtful that one measure of assessment will fit the needs of all political science departments.","486":"Attendance:  Regular and prompt attendance is essential.

Their conception of the sublime as power, immensity, and indefiniteness gave rise to literary responses, like the Gothic with its emphasis on terror and the Romantic with its emphasis on transcendence. In this course, we will begin by examining foundational writings on the sublime, with special attention given to those by Longinus, Burke, and Kant. We will then look at some of the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century responses to the sublime, beginning with the popular sublime of the Gothic novel, moving to the Gothic-Romantic of Coleridge, Byron and Shelley, and concluding with the philosophical sublime of Blake and Wordsworth.","516":"Parking. a.

Descartes, after all, arrived at his dualism by affirming his awareness of his thoughts whilst holding his awareness of his surroundings in question5. I (a whole person) am conscious of the things around me, but who is there to be aware of the things in me, to register my thoughts, and who manipulates my mental representations when I am actually thinking with them? Dennett6 has called this \"Hume's problem\". How can some inner I, some homunculus, be avoided? It will not do to think of the same whole person looking inward at representations just as he may look outward at objects, because the representations in question, and their vicissitudes, partly constitute this whole person. A person is not just the container for mental representations. Some sort of duality may indeed be demanded here - a representation can scarcely be aware of itself7 - and, perhaps because of this, most materialistically minded philosophers and psychologists tend to avoid the issue of conscious thought these days8. I want to sketch a sort of 'dualism' which can meet the problem without landing us with question begging homunculi9 or metaphysically otiose 'immaterial substances'10.","536":"I am also a member of IEEE.

I have no great quarrel with the general direction of Tye's thinking in these chapters, but I deprecate the genre. The original thought experiments, and perhaps the first two or three rounds of objections, objections to objections, and so on, may have offered valuable insights, but that stage is long past. They have become fodder for the publish-or-perish academic philosophy industry, and the resulting scholasticism can achieve little beyond persuading other cognitive scientists that listening to the philosophers is a waste of time. No consensus is discernable, and every finely honed argument soon meets its equally clever rebuttal. Although Tye handles this sort of stuff better than most, and one cannot help but admire his skill in juggling what has become extremely complex material, reading these chapters did not leave me feeling I understood the underlying substantive issues any better.","538":"Consultation between the Academic Senate and the University administration shall be defined as a mutual exchange of information, ideas, opinions and recommendations regarding policies and procedures affecting the operation of the University.","539":"We are developing a high-fidelity model of a full scale generic airbreathing hypersonic flight vehicle, (CSULA-GHV), with an integrated airframe-propulsion system configuration resembling an actual test vehicle.

The hold of current-traditional rhetoric on our composition classrooms has begun to weaken, and we have found science to be a very powerful tool for answering certain questions, but inadequate for others. Shall we return to Aristotle, Cicero and Quintilian? Do Kenneth Burke or Mikhail Bakhtin provide a twentieth-century solution? Do we need a rhetoric of Einstein's physics rather than Newton's?

The steering is very sensitive, and most of the controls like the accelerator and electric brakes are right on the steering wheel. To drive the car, you have to be very adept at using your fingers and holding on at the same time. While you're driving it, you know you're not polluting the air, and that gives you a good, green feeling. But working on a solar car makes you aware of how much time it takes to recharge the batteries so you can use it again. It's not as easy as pulling up to a gas station. The Solar Eagle III's probably not the car that's going to save the planet, but it's progress in the right direction.","644":"As outlined in the University Catalog, students wishing to pursue a graduate degree or certificate in the College of Arts and Letters must have an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution, and a 2.5 grade point average (4.0) system in the last 90 quarter units (60 semester hours), in order to qualify for regular admission to Cal State Los Angeles.

The current year's nominating committee announces the award program on campus and accepts nominations from either previously or currently enrolled students on an appropriate form similar to that provided for in the section above.","661":"Sometimes a writer or speaker will use what is called an ad hominem argument, an argument \"against the man.\" In this strategy, you attack the character or personality of the speaker instead of attacking the substance of his or her position. This kind of argument is usually considered to be a logical fallacy, but it can be very effective, and is quite common in politics.","662":"Second Level page, you will need the Second Level Banner.

They had food, all kinds of it, full of salt, fat, oil, grease and sugar; in those days, it was par for the course. They could eat all they wanted and their bodies would stay firm and fit, never yielding to gravity's implacable press. World War II was over, and so was the Depression, and gradually they stopped thinking of the sky falling down. Every night they went dancing or saw a show. They thought their youth would never run out.","665":"These are like Approximation Arguments. However, one approximates the figure from the outside and from the insided. One shows that each approximation has the requisite constant convergence. The figure in between the two, then, must have the same property. Such arguments were probably characteristic of Archimedes, but only survive in later authors.","666":"In particular, the claim that images can have a particular sort of vagueness or non-specificity impossible for pictures receives a whole chapter's consideration. Although forms of this argument have been influential, I had thought it long dead and buried at the hands of such as Hannay, Fodor and Block.

Similar passages that suggested the interesting aspects of the imagined scene would be in a downwards direction (e.g., watching from the top of a canyon as people rappel down its opposite wall), or to the left or right, produced significantly more saccades directed downwards, leftwards, and rightwards respectively, as compared to the control (and the earlier results of Jacobson (1932) suggest that even more such eye movements would probably be observed if they were not often being actively inhibited during imagery).","672":"A regression (Table 8, equation 2, hypothesis 4) of the comparative politics subsection score on GPA, the number-of-prior-major courses variable, and dichotomous variables for the Pre-legal, Public Administration, and World Politics options resulted in no significant coefficients at the 0.05 level. Three coefficients, however, were significant at the 0.10 level, but the dichotomous variable for majoring in the World Politics option was not among them. Overall this equation yielded a poorly fitting regression. In other words, after controlling for both the number-of-prior-major-courses variable and GPA, there is no significant difference between the students in the World Politics option and students in the other options on the comparative politics subsection score. In addition, none of the differences between the options in total GRE score or other subsection scores approaches statistical significance.","673":"Each of you will probably run into trouble a few times, during these exercises.  You will take a wrong turn and find yourself lost, not understanding why you are not seeing what the exercises tells you that you should be seeing.","674":"Scientific papers are quite different from the essay formats taught in Freshman Composition courses. The following structure is standard in the biological sciences and is similar to the format used in Chemistry and other natural sciences. This format is used to present your own experimental data and results. The review paper format should be used if you are evaluating journal articles or other published work done by others. Research papers are a common assignment in upper-division Biology courses.","675":"At any temperature or density, gas will emit or absorb in some part of the spectrum, making it very difficult to hide any gas in the solar neighborhood {8}. (Cold gas emits radio frequencies; hot gas, UV and X-ray light) Cold baryonic gas distributed uniformly around the Milky Way is therefore not possible, since we'd have seen absorption lines in light from other galaxies. In spiral galaxies, the gas that we know of tends to be more abundant in the the outer regions than near the central bulge. Cold gas as clumps or clouds of intergalactic material, as long as it's not in the line of sight of another galaxy, would remain unnoticed. We do see frequent occurrences of Lyman-alpha absorption lines in some quasars, and these clouds of intergalactic gas could be as large as a normal galaxy.","676":"Files of all faculty unit employees who are on the faculty five or more years will be kept in the appropriate dean's office for a period of five years after the faculty member has ceased being an active member of the faculty in any way (including FERPing).","677":"University courses, only courses in the primary major will be included.

Forensic Option and are required to submit a thesis as a culminating experience for the Masters Degree.  Students in the MFT program complete a comprehensive examination.","683":"However, as we learned, there is much more to implicit cognition than blindsight. Not only do other sorts of brain lesions give rise to other effects of this type (e.g. as reported by David Milner), but numerous experiments demonstrate its effects in normal subjects too. Indeed, it would seem that much of our ordinary functioning depends on implicit cognition; very probably the lion's share of our behaviour is guided much more by 'implicit' than by conscious knowledge. And a good thing too! Often, it seems, when consciousness is deceived, say by some sort of perceptual illusion, implicit cognition ensures that we actually respond to what is really there. Bruce Bridgeman reported that, even though subjects can be induced to misreport the positions of objects (through induced motion, static position illusions, etc.), if asked to jab or point at the object they will do so quite accurately. He interprets this as implying the existence of two distinct spatial representational systems, one to handle conscious experience and another, quite separate, that subserves visually guided action.","684":"Political   Science and the MS in Public Administration rotate among the faculty periodically.

The decision of which meeting(s) to attend must be made in consultation with your research director. Since meetings are announced months in advance, be sure that your travel arrangements are made as early as possible so we may get the best rates on airfare and hotels. The funds we have available for travel are limited, so the more wisely we use them, the more student travel we can accommodate.","689":"Tilove points out that some people protest the racial question by not filling it in.  Susan Graham, founder of Project RACE-Reclassify All Children Equally, and the mother of two biracial children, refused to answer the race question once she found out that \"for many government purposes\"  her children would \"simply be counted as black\" (2).  Her protest is moot, however, because the \"census cannot permit blanks,\" so it will use a \"statistical method known as 'hot dock imputation'\" to assign her family the race of her nearest neighbors (2).","690":"District (MWD) and the Department of Water and Power (DWP) have benefitted from the experience by hiring students involved in the process. The practical application of engineering and cutting-edge technology give Cal State L.A. graduates \"a leg up\" on the competition.","691":"Starting a new school can be a difficult experience, especially for a parent and a young child. We would like to introduce each family gradually to the program so that the family gets the necessary time to become comfortable with the school before leaving their child. For this reason parents are required to attend an initial orientation and visit the program for a minimum of three visits before beginning school. This gives the child an opportunity to assess the new situation while enjoying the security of a present parent.  This also forms the basis for building trust between teacher, child, and parent, which is necessary for future healthy separations.","692":"Let a segment less then a semicircle be erected perpendicular to a circle on a chord which is less than a diameter and let the segment be divided unequally at some point. Then the line from the point to the larger segment of the initial circles is smaller than the line to any other point on the circular-arc of the larger segment of the circle. The theorem considers other conditions, including the case where the segment is erected on a diameter.","693":"It seems that Zeno argues that the arrow is in a place equal to itself means that it is there for a stretch of time (where 'is' implies duration, as for Plato). Hence the arrow is there for a moment and is at rest.","694":"Mental Imagery for the Blind, by Peter Meijer.

For any instance in which the Dean of Extended Education and the dean of the college responsible for the academic discipline involved fail to reach agreement on approval for a course, the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs will serve as the final arbiter.","699":"We shall then switch back to the ancient world, first with a survey of Egyptians mathematics, Babylonian mathematics and astronomy, and then with Lloyd's survey of early Greek science. Plato's dialogue, Timaeus  and selections from Aristotle's Physics and Posterior Analytics will provide us with two views of what a scientific theory is supposed to accomplish. We shall interlace this discussion with examinations of ancient astronomical theories and mathematical practice, especially the planetary systems of Eudoxus and Hipparchus, and Ptolemy.","700":"Administrators who serve by virtue of their positions within the University or who are appointed by the President to serve as Executive Secretary do so in an ex officio non-voting capacity on all standing committees and subcommittees of the Academic Senate, i.e. they do not make motions, vote, nor serve as chair.","701":"Responsibility of the University.

As noted under \"Right to Free Speech\" above, \"policies and procedures\" prescribed by this Code explicitly exclude matters of content.","702":"The Scholars are in a position to interact with the best science faculty and students at the University. Since the natural sciences are fundamentally experimental disciplines, the Scholars will be introduced to research upon admission to the Program, and research participation will continue throughout all the academic years and summers the Scholar is in the Program. The research group is the basic unit we use to motivate and strengthen a student's desire for a career in biomedical research. Participation in a research group (coupled with a strong academic program) is excellent preparation for the student's graduate education to the Ph.D. A positive, rigorous, and productive experience performing publication-quality research as undergraduates is excellent preparation for graduate school, and be a very positive factor in developing a student's scientific maturity and supporting an interest in a research career. Cal State LA has more than 40 years experience in successful involvement of undergraduates in strong research programs.","703":"A key feature of the program is a close mentoring relationship with a faculty member who oversees the student's progress toward  his or her individual career goals. All students begin their program in the fall quarter and take several core courses together.  The program offers an M.S. degree and consists of 52 units of course work, which includes a 9 month  practicum where students receive hands on training and on site supervision in a forensic setting related to their individual interests and career goals (e.g., Rape crisis center, Department of Children and Family Services counseling center, the Dependency Courts, the Sheriff's Department, prisons, probation).  The program emphasizes theory and research, while providing practical training in the areas of assessment and treatment that will prepare them for their entree to the marketplace after graduation. The course of study is designed to accommodate both students who plan to progress on to doctoral study as well as students who wish to enter the field as Masters level practitioners.","704":"For equal straight-lines when placed in unequal circles at right angles to the diameter cut off smaller segments than the they do in larger circles (see brief proof below), but WU is equal to QZ.

The principal cognitive science debate about imagery, the so-called analog-propositional dispute, has been about the proper format for such representations. Pylyshyn (1978, 1981) argues that a discursive symbolic description is sufficient to account for the phenomenology and the experimental findings concerning imagery; Kosslyn (1980) argues that it is not sufficient, and that the symbolic description must be translated into a \"quasi-pictorial\" format when imagery is accessed.","755":"Hero, Mechanics i 33 diagram from N&S same diagram made pleasing People think that the inverse proportion <lacuna, persumably, cannot hold where the beam is irregular>. (diagram 1) Let us also suppose the beam of the balance as keeping the weight in equilibrium and as being thick from any material in any part and let there be an equilibrium when it hangs from point G. And our conception of the equilibrium in this case is that the beam would stay at rest and remain fixed even if it tilted to one of the two sides, then (diagram 2) we hang weights at any two points there are, namely E, D and let the beam also be in equilibrium after the hanging of the weights. And so Archimedes proves that the ratio of the weight to the weight in this situation is also inversely as the ratio of the distance to the distance. On the other hand, in materials that are not regular (orderly), which bend over the distance, here we should suppose in this circumstance the following.","756":"Analysis of crowd types, formation, and dynamics, including mobs, riots, panics, mass hysteria, rumors, fads, and fashion.

Aristotle discusses three categories of invention: ethos, or appeals to the character or authority of the speaker; logos, or appeals to logic or rational argument; and pathos, appeals to the emotions or feelings of the audience. In the last century, the rhetoric taught in American schools has tended to focus on rational arguments only, treat invention as part of arrangement, or deny that invention is a legitimate part of rhetoric at all (Berlin Writing Instruction 64-65).","805":"Some other proposals to insure early retirees have been attached to the idea of increasing the Medicare eligibility age to match planned increases in the Social Security eligibility age. For example, the Kerrey-Danforth Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement Reform proposed that a Medicare buy-in option be considered along with a gradual increase in the age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 70. Although the Social Security eligibility age will rise from 65 to 67, workers who choose to retire as early as age 62 are eligible for a reduced level of benefits. A Medicare buy-in would create a similar reduced benefit: Medicare benefits for a higher premium (U.S., Bipartisan Commission..., 1995, 16).","806":"Axions, extremely light hypothetical particles whose name was taken from an old brand of laundry detergent{1}, are a prime candidate for non- baryonic dark matter. They were proposed independently in 1978 by Steven Weinberg of the Univ. of Texas (who proposed the name) and Frank Wilczek of Princeton. Axions were produced in the early universe during a violation of CP invariance. Three types of invariance apply to the laws of physics: Charge invariance (C), the conservation of overall charge; Parity invariance (P), which maintains that if the laws work for a certain system S, then they should hold for a system S' spatially reflected through the origin; and Time invariance (T), which maintains that the laws work when time is running either forwards or backwards. The laws of physics are governed by CPT invariance (all three operating simultaneously), but violations of P invariance and CP invariance exist. In the very early universe, symmetries began to break down at some point, leading to a violation of CP invariance.","807":"Revolution included spending time in a Chinese prison as a result of his research.

Other legislation and administrative actions seem to have had modest results. In general, then, incremental approaches, as Marmor stated in 1994, are \"politically possible,\" but are characterized by significant drawbacks, in particular the difficulty of working within the constraints of a system where employers have considerable choice and those without health insurance are both politically inactive and characterized by an extremely heterogeneous makeup.","823":"Student Conduct Code proceedings are independent from other court proceedings.

Given also that, pace Fodor, CR no longer seems to be \"the only game in town\" in cognitive science, it seems to me that the time might be ripe for looking beyond CR for our account of imagery, and regarding imagery research once again as a significant challenge to this framework. Non-pictorial, non-CR imagery theories certainly exist. There are several extant versions (all, admittedly, in a somewhat underdeveloped state) of what I call \"perceptual activity theories\" the best known being that of Neisser (1976). I have discussed and advocated this sort of theory elsewhere (Thomas, in press). Tye, however, betrays no awareness of the possibility of any sort of imagery theory beyond pictorialism and descriptionism. His book is aptly titled. It is about the (or, at least, an) imagery debate.

For instance, he seems quite unaware that nearly all the experimental phenomena which persuaded psychologists of the cognitive reality of mental imagery -- its mnemonic effects; mental rotation; selective interference; and the mental scanning and size\/inspection time effects which Kosslyn himself discovered -- have since been demonstrated in congenitally blind subjects, who seem unlikely, to say the least, to be capable of recalling visual sense impressions. Although their performances very likely involve haptic imagery there does not seem to be much scope for giving haptic mode explanations consistent in form with the visual mode accounts suggested by quasi- pictorialism (Thomas, in press).","843":"Trippe and Stavrianos (1998, 2) define a microsimulation model as one that \"simulates how a change to a government transfer program would affect the costs and caseload of that program.\" Citro and Hanushek state that microsimulations are \"large, complex models that produce estimates of the effects on program costs and who would gain and who would lose from proposed changes in government policies ranging from health care to welfare to taxes\"","844":"I want to try and sketch a solution to it drawing on the conceptual resources of current psychology, rather than waiting on the millennium.

(diagram 7) Thus, if a magnitude equal to Z is placed on each of the segments in LH, having the center of weight on the middle of the segment, then the totality of magnitudes are equal to A and E will be the center of the weight composed from all of them. For the totality will be even in number and the ones on each side of E will be equal in number since LE is equal to HE. (diagram 8) Similarly, it will be proved that even if a magnitude equal to Z is placed on each side of the segments in KH, having its center of weight on the middle segment, then the totality of the magnitudes will be equal to B and D will be the center of the weight composed from all of them. (diagram 9) And so A placed on it will be at E, while B placed on it will be at D. In fact, there will be magnitudes equal to one another lying in a straight line whose centers of weight will be equally distant from one another, while being even in multitude. And so it is clear that the bisection of the line having the centers of the magnitudes in between is the center of the magnitude composed from all of them. Since LE is equal to GD, and EG to DK, therefore the whole LG is also equal to GK. Thus, point G is the center of the weight of the magnitude composed from all of them. (diagram 1) Therefore, when A is placed at E and B at D, they balance at G.","877":"There were several competing proposals to provide health insurance to those under 18, of which the most publicized was a proposal from Senators Kennedy and Hatch for a five-year, $20 billion block grant to the states to expand health insurance coverage for as many as five million children.

It was proposed, by one of the whites, to set fire immediately to the hut, and thus to force the rebels to surrender. The advice was followed; but Mr. Edwards charged his people to spare their prisoners.

This seems to be essentially the same as Locke's distinction between secondary qualities as powers in objects, and the ideas of these qualities (the qualitative experiences) as they occur in our minds. Ross is apparently led to accept this distinction because he thinks it is the same as the unquestionably real distinction between surface reflectances and the neural processes involved in color perception. But although it does not contradict his main argument, I think Ross is ill advised to be following Hardin here. In doing so he is buying into the Lockean\/Cartesian representative theory of perception, which may, perhaps, be a corollary of the notion of secondary qualities, but is surely not necessary for color realism. Indeed, once we allow that \"sensory qualities\" are in the mind then the issue between color realists like Ross and subjectivists like Hardin becomes little more than a trivial verbal dispute over whether the distal causes of color experiences (\"sensed colors\") or the experiences caused by them (\"sensory qualities\") are more truly deserving of being honored with the simple name \"colors\". What is more (inasmuch as it would matter) prima facie, at least, the subjectivist would seem to have the stronger case (for the reasons already noted when discussing Locke's version of the distinction).","889":"The 21st Century Librarian Awards were established four years ago to recognize librarians who have become leaders in shaping the evolution of this new information environment.

Such individual differences might be taken to explain the peculiarly irreconcilable disputes over the nature and cognitive significance of imagery which have periodically broken out among psychologists and philosophers. However, to so explain these disputes is itself to take a substantive and questionable position on the cognitive role of imagery. This article distinguishes three separable issues over which people can be \"for\" or \"against\" mental images. Conflation of these issues can lead to theoretical differences being mistaken for experiential differences, even by theorists themselves. This is applied to the case of John B. Watson, who inaugurated a half-century of neglect of image psychology. Watson originally claimed to have vivid imagery; by 1913 he was denying the existence of images.","899":"Some activities are in and of themselves unprofessional and therefore incompatible with the aims and objectives of the institution.

However, consider two photographs of Leo. Each photo resembles the other more than either resemble the lion (both photos are small, rectangular pieces of card, similarly marked, and neither is carnivorous or furry), yet we would normally want to say that they represent Leo, and not that they represent each other. Of course, a photograph of Leo does resemble him, when the right aspects of resemblance are considered, but in this regard Leo equally resembles the photograph. We are unlikely, however, to want to say that he represents it. In order for resemblance to play a role in representation, the relevant aspects of resemblance have to be recognized, and the resembling object has to be used (or, at least, taken) as a representation. But surely, before a cognitive system can recognize or use the relevant aspects of resemblance between a photograph (or an inner quasi-picture) and an object (or a percept), it must already be able to represent the picture and its object, and their various features, to itself. The mind's power to recognize resemblance seemingly depends on its power to represent things, rather than vice-versa.","913":"Students whose GPA in all courses taken after becoming classified or conditionally classified falls below 3.0 may be subject to probation and disqualification, using the same timelines as given above.

As I have argued elsewhere (Thomas, 1999), instead of viewing perception as a matter of the inflow of information into the brain, and eventually into the proper format of mental representation that will be available to consciousness, such theories treat it as a continual process of purposeful interactive interrogation of the environment. Rather than the mind being the brain and its activities, mind consists in this constant process of reciprocal interaction between organism and environment. The role of the brain is not to receive representations but to coordinate the organism\/environment interaction so that it is responsive to the organism's needs and the actual environmental situation, as this is progressively discovered. By rejecting the idea that any of the brain processes or states involved in perception are to be identified with the percept or the experience, theories of this type allow a color realist like Ross to evade Hardin's \"sensed color\"\/\"sensory quality\" distinction, and thus avoid triviality. On this view, the mind is there in the world (Clark, 1997) rather than being a spectator locked away in the skull, merely reflecting the world in its representations. Clark & Chalmers (1998) even go so far to speak about an \"extended mind\", the boundaries of the self, as a cognitive system, extending beyond the skull and the skin to encompass the things with which we interact. Taking this literally, it would even make sense to say that color experiences exist in the mind after all, but as qualities of the surfaces of the objects around us, rather than as mysterious qualia inside the brain.","923":"Although these summaries will not become part of the final portfolio, if you do not complete all of these assignments I will not accept your portfolio.

Such functions range from ordinary supposal to the most valued aspects of human insight and creativity (Thomas, 1997a, 1999), but it is the latter that will be of particular concern here. The issue is raised not only to bring a fresh perspective to the notoriously recalcitrant scientific debate about the nature and cognitive importance of imagery, but also to try to illuminate the obscure topic of imagination itself. Prima facie imagery and imagination are intimately related--certainly \"imagination\" is often used to name the faculty of image production (or the mental arena in which images appear)--and this fact itself demands explanation.","929":"If you access an on-line version of an article, be sure to download the copy that contains graphs, charts, and tables.

Indeed, I developed my version of Perceptual Activity theory largely through the attempt to understand the implications, and work out some of the details and ambiguities, of Neisser's very suggestive and insightful, but sometimes rather vague and loosely formulated, theoretical ideas. In hindsight, perhaps my exposition (Thomas, 1999) would have been clearer if I had coined a new bit of jargon to replace the overused \"schema\", but nothing suitably pithy springs to mind, and, in any case, I did not want to distance myself from Neisser, or conceal my very real debt to his work .","973":"Students who have completed these courses know how to get started on a writing task, how to generate and organize ideas, how to paragraph, and how to write introductions and conclusions.

And now the paradox: since the outer angle can increase ad infinitum and the inner can be diminished, and again the inner can be increased ad infinitum and the outer diminished, neither will the outer increasing ad infinitum ever become equal to an acute rectilinear angle, but will always be smaller than every one, nor will the inner angle increasing ad infinitum every be equal to a right angle. We increase the outer angle by drawing smaller circles. For example, suppose I divide GB diameter at point E and bisect line GE at point Z and draw a circle with center Z and diameter ZG, whose semicircle is GHE. Then the outer angle AGH increases, and again is no less smaller than every acute angle for the mentioned reason.","990":"This is a graduate course which requires active participation from all members.
